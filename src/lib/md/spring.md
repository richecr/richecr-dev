# Spring

---

Spring is a comprehensive programming and configuration model for modern Java-based enterprise applications - on any kind of deployment platform. Developed initially by Rod Johnson and released in 2003 under the Apache 2.0 license, Spring Framework provides a robust infrastructure support for developing Java applications. Spring handles the infrastructure so developers can focus on building application business logic.

Springâ€™s core feature is dependency injection which promotes loose coupling through inversion of control. The framework's modularity allows it to be used piecemeal with many other frameworks. It is also well-known for its transaction management, sophisticated integration with messaging systems, and its dynamic response to the demands of real-time enterprises.

Spring is:

- **Comprehensive**: It provides a wide range of capabilities including but not limited to transaction management, security, JDBC operations, web application development, and more, via its various projects like Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, and Spring Security.
- **Flexible**: Spring is designed to be highly configurable with minimal impact on application code, supporting both XML and annotation-based configuration.
- **Extensible**: Thanks to its modular architecture, developers can easily adapt and extend the framework by plugging in their own implementation of specific framework interfaces.

Example:
```java
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestParam;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@SpringBootApplication
@RestController
public class HelloApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(HelloApplication.class, args);
    }

    @GetMapping("/hello")
    public String sayHello(@RequestParam(value = "name", defaultValue = "World") String name) {
        return String.format("Hello %s!", name);
    }
}
```

Spring stands out in the enterprise Java community for its depth, providing extensive infrastructure support and enabling developers to create high-performing, robust applications efficiently.
