# Grupo OLX

---

Currently, I'm part of the Integrations team (best team at OLX lol). In our team, we are responsible for millions of ads published on platforms such as OLX, ZAP and Viva Real through integrations developed to meet the needs of our professional clients.

As part of the team, we work to ensure that our professional clients' integrators are running smoothly and that their ad posts and updates are completed quickly and accurately. Additionally, we have the responsibility of sending leads to professional clients' CRMs.

Our work is highly technical and requires a high level of precision and attention to detail. We are always seeking to improve our knowledge of technologies relevant to our work and documentation of our integrations can be found at https://developers.olx.com.br and https://developers.grupozap.com/.

I am happy to be part of a team that is recognized for its excellence and to work in a challenging and stimulating environment, in which I can learn and grow professionally.
