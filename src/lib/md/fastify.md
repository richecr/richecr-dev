# Fastify

---

Fastify is a high-performance, low-overhead web framework for Node.js. It was created by Matteo Collina and Tomas Della Vedova in 2016, designed to be a faster alternative to Express by focusing on providing a faster foundation for web applications and APIs. Fastify leverages a schema-based approach to serialize and validate data, which significantly enhances its speed and efficiency.

One of the standout features of Fastify is its extensive plugin architecture, allowing developers to extend its capabilities with plugins without compromising on performance. It also supports asynchronous request handling out of the box, making it suitable for handling high levels of concurrency and I/O-heavy operations typical in modern web applications.

Fastify is:

- **Efficient**: Designed with performance in mind, it offers quick server startup and request processing times, with low overhead per request.
- **Scalable**: Its non-blocking nature and efficient handling of requests make it an excellent choice for applications expecting high traffic volumes.
- **Developer-friendly**: Fastify provides a robust ecosystem of plugins, detailed documentation, and built-in schema-based validation to simplify the development process.

Example:
```javascript
const fastify = require('fastify')({ logger: true })

fastify.get('/', async (request, reply) => {
  return { hello: 'world' }
})

fastify.listen(3000, (err, address) => {
  if (err) {
    fastify.log.error(err)
    process.exit(1)
  }
  fastify.log.info(`server listening on ${address}`)
})
```

Fastify stands out in the Node.js ecosystem for its focus on performance and scalability, making it a compelling choice for developers looking to build fast, efficient web applications.
