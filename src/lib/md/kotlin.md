# Kotlin

---

Kotlin is a modern, statically typed programming language that was developed by JetBrains and first released in 2011. It is designed to be fully interoperable with Java, allowing developers to use both languages seamlessly within the same project. Kotlin addresses many of the shortcomings of Java, such as verbosity and null pointer exceptions, by providing a more concise syntax and built-in null safety.

The language runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and can also be compiled to JavaScript source code or use the LLVM compiler infrastructure to target native binaries. Kotlin is object-oriented and also supports functional programming features, such as lambdas and higher-order functions, which make the code more expressive and concise.

Kotlin is:

- **Concise**: Kotlin reduces boilerplate code, which makes programs easier to read and write. Its concise syntax also leads to fewer coding errors and, consequently, more robust code.
- **Safe**: With built-in null safety and immutability features, Kotlin helps prevent common programming errors such as null pointer exceptions, making the codebase more reliable.
- **Interoperable**: Kotlin is fully interoperable with Java, allowing developers to use all existing Java libraries and frameworks, making it a versatile choice for new and existing projects.

Example:
```kotlin
fun main() {
    var counter = 1
    val doubled = doubleValue(counter)
    println("$counter * 2 = $doubled")
    counter += 1
}

fun doubleValue(x: Int): Int {
    return x * 2
}
```

```bash
1 * 2 = 2
```

Increment button:
```kotlin
counter += 1
```

Kotlin is a versatile, modern programming language developed by JetBrains, acclaimed for its conciseness, safety features, and seamless interoperability with Java, making it a popular choice for both Android development and server-side applications.
