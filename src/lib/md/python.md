# Python

---

Here's a description for Python, crafted in a similar style to the one used for Svelte:

Python is a high-level, open-source programming language created by Guido van Rossum and maintained by members of the global Python community. Unlike compiled languages, Python is interpreted, meaning that code is executed line by line, which can ease debugging and iterative development. Python's design emphasizes code readability, allowing programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in other languages. Additionally, Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming.

The standard interpreter is written in C, and the language is licensed under the Python Software Foundation License, with its source code hosted on GitHub.

Python is:

- **Intuitive**: Python simplifies the complexity of software development, removing common barriers to entry for programming thanks to its clear syntax and vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks.
- **Versatile**: From web development to machine learning, Python provides robust tools and specialized frameworks such as Django for web and TensorFlow for AI, ensuring you have everything you need at your fingertips.
- **Interactive**: With support for interactivity through notebooks like Jupyter, Python makes it easy to experiment and share code, fostering a vibrant and collaborative community.

Example:
```python
counter = 1

def double(x):
    return x * 2

doubled = double(counter)
print(f"{counter} * 2 = {doubled}")

counter += 1
```

```bash
1 * 2 = 2
```

Increment button:
```python
counter += 1
```
