# Pandas

---

Pandas is a powerful, open-source data analysis and manipulation library for Python, providing data structures and data analysis tools designed for cleaning and exploring complex datasets. Created by Wes McKinney in 2008, pandas is built on top of NumPy and is integral to data science workflows in Python.

Pandas makes it easy to handle missing data, manipulate date indices, perform aggregations, and filter, sort, and summarize data. It is renowned for its ease of use, performance, and flexibility, particularly with structured data. The library includes two primary data structures: Series (one-dimensional) and DataFrame (two-dimensional), which can handle a vast range of data types.

Features of pandas include:

- **Data Alignment**: Intrinsic data alignment allows for automatic alignment of data drawn from different sources and indexed differently without any user intervention.
- **Powerful Data Structures**: The DataFrame and Series data structures are designed for practical, real-world data analysis needs.
- **Time Series Functionality**: Pandas has extensive capabilities and features for working with time series data for all domains.
- **Handling Missing Data**: Pandas is equipped to handle missing data using rules that can be modified as needed.

Example:
```python
import pandas as pd

# Creating a DataFrame from a dictionary
data = {'Name': ['John', 'Anna', 'James', 'Linda'],
        'Age': [28, 22, 35, 32],
        'City': ['New York', 'Paris', 'London', 'Berlin']}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Displaying the DataFrame
print(df)

# Basic data filtering
adults = df[df['Age'] > 30]
print("\nAdults:\n", adults)
```

Pandas is essential for anyone working in data analysis or data science in Python, providing powerful and flexible tools needed for cutting-edge data manipulation and analysis. It is widely used in academic and commercial domains for statistics, finance, neuroscience, economics, web analytics, and much more.
