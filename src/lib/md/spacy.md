# Spacy

---

spaCy is a powerful and advanced library for Natural Language Processing (NLP) in Python, developed by Explosion AI. First released in 2015, it's designed specifically for production use and can be used to build information extraction or natural language understanding systems, or to pre-process text for deep learning.

Unlike many other NLP libraries, spaCy focuses on providing software for production usage. It includes pre-trained statistical models and word vectors, and it supports over 60+ languages. It features state-of-the-art speed and processing capabilities, as well as easy-to-use tokenization and tagging, syntactic parsing, named entity recognition, and machine learning integration.

Features of spaCy include:

- **High Performance**: With industrial-strength natural language processing capabilities, spaCy is built to be fast, robust, and efficient.
- **Pre-trained Models**: spaCy includes multiple pre-trained models for various languages, trained on large datasets such as web text, news articles, and Wikipedia.
- **Pipeline Customization**: Users can customize and extend spaCy's processing pipeline with their own components and models, integrating tools like custom machine learning models or external databases.

Example:
```python
import spacy

# Load the pre-trained English model
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

# Process a text
doc = nlp("Apple is looking at buying U.K. startup for $1 billion")

# Token attributes
for token in doc:
    print(token.text, token.lemma_, token.pos_, token.is_stop)

# Named entity recognition
for ent in doc.ents:
    print(ent.text, ent.label_)
```

spaCy is widely regarded as one of the go-to libraries for any NLP task in Python, from simple tokenization to complex entity recognition, making it a key tool in the arsenal of data scientists, linguists, and AI developers.
